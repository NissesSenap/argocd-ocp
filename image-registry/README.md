# Image registry

"oc explain config" dosen't contain allot so here you can find the [explnation of the api](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/registry/configuring-registry-operator.html)

## Storage

I tried to find a general way to manage storage.
But the difference ways in the big clouds is to big so I can't find a way to create a easy if case in the helm chart.

As always see this repo as an example and adjust to your environment.
